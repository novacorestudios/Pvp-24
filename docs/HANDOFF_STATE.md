- Next: verify this checkpoint CI; complete Milestone 6 fill/protection lifecycle, including reservation reconciliation/release and actual post-fill compliance integration.
- Code: immutable Fill/Side types, precision-34 Decimal helpers, canonical IDs, SQLite WAL events/snapshots/write-ahead intents, fail-closed paper guard. Causal Timing/Candle/Mark/rule/security models, as-of revision selection, 30-day gap warmup, deterministic historical Top-20 and stale-universe grace implemented. Streaming Wilder ATR, channel/RVOL, exact long/short transitions, restartable indicator checkpoints, cooldown/status gates and timed simultaneous batch ranking implemented. Risk foundations now include rounded protective-stop costs, separate arrival shortfall gate, causal funding reserve with explicit coverage, immutable open/pending portfolio reservations and proportional confirmed-exit release. Descending quantity-step sizing, 1..5x minimum feasible leverage, isolated tier-consistent liquidation reconstruction, reduce-only post-fill action interface and transactional reservation+ENTRY intent are implemented. Execution market models now include sequence-consistent L2, consumed-depth replay, strict IOC caps and gates, partial sweep previews, and labelled preliminary OHLC proxies. Fill/protection lifecycle, execution adapter and backtest remain unimplemented. Exchange liquidation validation is still absent; actual post-fill collateral must come from the adapter, not a hypothetical newly opened smaller position.
- Data: none acquired; OHLCV/Mark/funding/historical rules/security-master/L2 coverage remains unassessed. No backtest evidence, PRELIMINARY or VERIFIED.
- PAPER: NOT READY. LIVE: DISABLED. No orders sent.
- Original source and baseline config hashes unchanged. See config/manifest.json.
- Deviation: existing repository display capitalization Pvp-24 retained. No alpha changes.
- Artifacts: local artifacts/freqtrade-smoke.log and install logs; successful commands in docs/REPRODUCE.md.
- No automated background restart is configured or claimed.

Milestone 3 initial CI passed: https://github.com/novacorestudios/Pvp-24/actions/runs/35423805823. Review follow-up: unknown IOC/stop support now defaults to false; expired rules are rejected at their effective_to boundary.

## Current publication and credit checkpoint

The user requested frequent GitHub checkpoints and a status update before credit exhaustion where detectable. Remaining credits are not exposed to this process. Publish tested milestones promptly; if any usage-limit warning appears, preserve changes and report the exact remote HEAD/next action without promising background reactivation.

## Solver limitations carried into execution work

Exact descending step search preserves largest-feasible semantics even across rounding/tier discontinuities. It is not performance-qualified for extremely fine quantity increments; dispatch deadlines must still reject late results. No real Binance liquidation fixture has been acquired: all new tests are synthetic mathematics/concurrency tests, not exchange validation. The post-fill action wrapper requires an adapter-backed residual-position solver with confirmed fills, unchanged original stop, and known collateral/reduction costs. Do not pass entry sizing as if closing automatically released or restored collateral.
