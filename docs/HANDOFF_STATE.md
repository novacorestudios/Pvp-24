- Next: verify this checkpoint CI; complete Milestone 5 liquidation adapter and deterministic quantity solver.
- Code: immutable Fill/Side types, precision-34 Decimal helpers, canonical IDs, SQLite WAL events/snapshots/write-ahead intents, fail-closed paper guard. Causal Timing/Candle/Mark/rule/security models, as-of revision selection, 30-day gap warmup, deterministic historical Top-20 and stale-universe grace implemented. Streaming Wilder ATR, channel/RVOL, exact long/short transitions, restartable indicator checkpoints, cooldown/status gates and timed simultaneous batch ranking implemented. Risk foundations now include rounded protective-stop costs, separate arrival shortfall gate, causal funding reserve with explicit coverage, immutable open/pending portfolio reservations and proportional confirmed-exit release. Liquidation/sizing, execution and backtest remain unimplemented.
- Data: none acquired; OHLCV/Mark/funding/historical rules/security-master/L2 coverage remains unassessed. No backtest evidence, PRELIMINARY or VERIFIED.
- PAPER: NOT READY. LIVE: DISABLED. No orders sent.
- Original source and baseline config hashes unchanged. See config/manifest.json.
- Deviation: existing repository display capitalization Pvp-24 retained. No alpha changes.
- Artifacts: local artifacts/freqtrade-smoke.log and install logs; successful commands in docs/REPRODUCE.md.
- No automated background restart is configured or claimed.

Milestone 3 initial CI passed: https://github.com/novacorestudios/Pvp-24/actions/runs/35423805823. Review follow-up: unknown IOC/stop support now defaults to false; expired rules are rejected at their effective_to boundary.

## Current publication and credit checkpoint

The user requested frequent GitHub checkpoints and a status update before credit exhaustion where detectable. Remaining credits are not exposed to this process. Publish tested milestones promptly; if any usage-limit warning appears, preserve changes and report the exact remote HEAD/next action without promising background reactivation.
